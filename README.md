# NASA Udacity

Our project repository for the `Google Mobile Web Challenge 2017`.

> Pairing on Monday 10am CET

We decided to start a new project, in order to solidify our knowledge about Progressive Web Apps and Service Workers and decided to use these core technologies for our project:

- Firebase (Backend & Database)
- ReactJS (Front End)
- Service Workers
- crontab (cron job)
